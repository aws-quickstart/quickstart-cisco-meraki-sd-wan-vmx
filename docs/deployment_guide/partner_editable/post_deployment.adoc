// Include any postdeployment steps here, such as steps necessary to test that the deployment was successful. If there are no postdeployment steps, leave this file empty.

== Postdeployment steps

After deployment, you must do the following:

* Attach the workload VPCs to the transit gateway. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/tgw-vpc-attachments.html[Transit gateway attachments to a VPC].
* Update the VPC route table for the workload subnets. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/WorkWithRouteTables.html#AddRemoveRoutes[Add and remove routes from a route table].

== vMX HA architecture
//Provide any other information of interest to users, especially focusing on areas where AWS or cloud usage differs from on-premises usage.
The deployment architecture is fault tolerant with two vMX instances in different Availability Zones. An AWS Lambda function handles instance-level failures by checking the state of vMX EC2 instances. For software-level failures, it checks the vMX health state on the {partner-product-short-name} dashboard. In the case of a vMX instance failure, the AWS Lambda function logs the error in CloudWatch and updates the VPC and transit gateway routes to point to a healthy instance.

**To recover a failed Meraki vMX instance**

. Sign in to the https://dashboard.meraki.com/[Meraki dashboard^].
. Generate a new authentication token for the failed instance. For more information, see step 4 in the link:#_meraki_dashboard_configuration[Meraki Dashboard Configuration] section, previously in this guide.
. Deploy a new vMX stack. For deployment links, see link:#_launch_the_quick_start[Launch the Quick Start], previously in this guide. On the *Specify Stack Details* page in the CloudFormation console, specify the following parameters:
** `InstanceType`. Choose the same Amazon EC2 instance type that you specified during the previous deployment.
** `KeyPairName`. Enter the name of an existing EC2 key pair.
** `SubnetID`. Select the SubnetID to deploy the vMX instance.
** `vMXNetworkTag`. Specify the network tag associated with the vMX instance on the Meraki dashboard.
** `vMXToken`. Enter the new authentication token generated from the Meraki dashboard.

== Best practices for using {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
// Provide post-deployment best practices for using the technology on AWS, including considerations such as migrating data, backups, ensuring high performance, high availability, etc. Link to software documentation for detailed information.
For best practices, see https://documentation.meraki.com/MX/MX_Installation_Guides/vMX_Setup_Guide_for_Amazon_Web_Services_(AWS)#Meraki%20Dashboard%20Configuration[vMX Setup Guide for Amazon Web Services (AWS)^].
