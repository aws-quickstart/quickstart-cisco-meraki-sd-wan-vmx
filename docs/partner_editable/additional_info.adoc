// Add steps as necessary for accessing the software, post-configuration, and testing. Don’t include full usage instructions for your software, but add links to your product documentation for that information.
//Should any sections not be applicable, remove them

== Postdeployment steps
After deployment, you must do the following:

* Attach the workload VPCs to the transit gateway. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/tgw-vpc-attachments.html[Transit gateway attachments to a VPC^].
* Update the SD-WAN VCP route table for the workload subnets. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/WorkWithRouteTables.html#AddRemoveRoutes[Add and remove routes from a route table^].

== vMX HA architecture
//Provide any other information of interest to users, especially focusing on areas where AWS or cloud usage differs from on-premises usage.
The deployment architecture is fault tolerant, with two instances in different Availability Zones. The AWS Lambda function addresses instance-level failures by checking the EC2 instance state of the vMX. For software-level failures, it checks the vMX health state from the {partner-product-short-name} dashboard. In the case of a vMX instance failure, the AWS Lambda function logs the error in CloudWatch and updates the VPC and transit gateway routes to point to a healthy instance.

**To recover a failed Meraki vMX instance**

. Log in to the https://dashboard.meraki.com/[Meraki dashboard^].
. Generate a new authentication token for the failed instance. For more information, see step 4 in the link:#_meraki_dashboard_configuration[Meraki Dashboard Configuration] section, previously in this guide.
. Deploy a new vMX stack. For deployment links, see link:#_launch_the_quick_start[Launch the Quick Start], previously in this guide. On the *Specify Stack Details* page in the CloudFormation console, specify the following parameters:
.. **InstanceType.** Choose the same Amazon EC2 instance type that you specified during the previous deployment.
.. **KeyPairName.** Enter an existing EC2 key pair.
.. **SubnetID.** Select the SubnetID to deploy the vMX instance.
.. **vMXNetworkTag.** Specify the network tag associated with the vMX instance on the Meraki dashboard.
.. **vMXToken.** Enter the new authentication token generated from the Meraki dashboard.

== Best practices for using {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
// Provide post-deployment best practices for using the technology on AWS, including considerations such as migrating data, backups, ensuring high performance, high availability, etc. Link to software documentation for detailed information.
