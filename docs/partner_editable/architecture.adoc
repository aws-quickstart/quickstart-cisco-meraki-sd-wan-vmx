As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A VPC configured with public subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* An internet gateway that connects the VPC to the internet.
* A VPC route table associated with the public subnets to specify routing rules for outbound internet traffic.
* In the public subnets, Meraki vMX appliances on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances.
* AWS Transit Gateway attached to the VPC, enabling connectivity to attached workload VPCs in other AWS Regions.
* A transit gateway route table associated with the VPC for routing rules to AWS Transit Gateway.
* Amazon CloudWatch to collect logs of vMX instance performance.
* AWS Lambda to monitor the state of the vMX instances. If an instance fails, AWS Lambda updates route tables to point to a healthy instance and logs the event in CloudWatch.
* AWS Secrets Manager to store a Meraki API key. AWS Lambda uses the API key to access the Meraki dashboard when updating route tables.
